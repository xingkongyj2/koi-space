Every AI browser tries to be both a browser *and* an agent. Keep your normal Chrome — this is just the agent half.

Ports your cookies into a fresh Chromium so agents are logged in everywhere you are, and spawns tasks from anywhere with a keyboard shortcut.

Built on [Browser Harness](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-harness).
