## Test Suite Detail

### Vitest (unit + integration + regression)

- **Files:** tests/unit/ (7 files), tests/pill/ (1 file), tests/integration/ (1 file), tests/regression/no-global-shortcuts.spec.ts
- **Result:** 9 files, 118 tests, 0 failures
- **Duration:** ~230ms

### E2E Playwright

- **Config:** tests/setup/playwright.config.ts

- **Result:** 24 passed, 10 skipped (skips are intentional gating on packaged binary)
- **Notable:** agent-task-wiki passed (55.8s) with CDP fallback path; daemon-crash-recovery 4/4; multi-instance 34 passed

### Python pytest

- **Root:** app/python/

## Failures and Triage

### ESLint — 29 remaining errors (pre-existing)

Pre-existing at start of sweep: 34. Fixed this sweep: 5.

| File | Error | Status |
|---|---|---|
| config/sentry.ts | no-useless-escape in Bearer regex | FIXED |
| src/main/presence.ts | no-empty-function (2x no-op arrows) | FIXED |
| src/main/tabs/TabManager.ts | import/no-unresolved for `uuid` | FIXED |
| src/main/updater.ts | import/no-unresolved for `electron-updater` | FIXED |
| Various renderers, test files, daemon client | no-empty-function, Function type, no-var-requires, react-hooks/exhaustive-deps | PRE-EXISTING — not addressed in QA sweep |

Triage note: The 29 remaining errors are spread across renderer TSX, e2e test specs, and the daemon client stub. They are pre-existing and do not block functionality. The `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` plugin is missing (`react-hooks` not in devDependencies). The `Function` type errors and `no-empty-function` errors in stubs are intentional no-ops pending v0.2 implementation.

### TypeScript typecheck — node_modules errors

All 100+ TS errors are in `node_modules/@types/node` and `node_modules/@types/babel__traverse`. Root cause: TS 4.5.5 cannot parse TypeScript 4.7+ syntax used in newer `@types/node` (e.g. `NoInfer<T>`, function overloads with `using`). The tsconfig already has `"skipLibCheck": true` but TS 4.5 fails to parse before skipping in some edge cases. **Zero errors in src/**. Resolution: upgrade TS to 5.x (requires user action, no npm install in this session).

### Visual capture — settings screens

Root cause: `SettingsWindow.loadFile()` path resolves to `.vite/renderer/settings/settings.html` which exists in dev builds but the test harness launches Electron in dev mode pointing at the Vite dev server URL for the shell window. The settings IPC trigger (`open-settings` menu item) requires the full app Menu to be registered, which only happens in the real packaged/forked app. Known blocker since iter 2. Safe approach (P3) documented in plan file.

### Regression suite — invocation confusion

`tests/regression/no-global-shortcuts.spec.ts` is a Vitest test (imports from `vitest`). Running it with `npx playwright test tests/regression/` fails with CJS/ESM import error. Correct invocation is `npx vitest run` which already includes it via `vitest.config.ts`. `tests/regression/preload-path.spec.ts` is a Playwright test and runs correctly under `npx playwright test tests/e2e/` (it's also importable as part of that suite since playwright.config.ts picks up regression dir). No fix needed — this is a documentation gap, not a code bug.

## Known Blockers

| Blocker | Since | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Settings visual captures | iter 2 | `SETTINGS_VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` undefined; `loadFile` path needs Forge build. Safe fix: P3 option (b). |
| onboarding-account-scopes capture | iter 2 | Google OAuth opens external browser; needs mock injection. |
| Figma sync | iter 4 | OAuth URL generated; requires user to visit + paste callback. Deferred. |
| TS upgrade (4.5 → 5.x) | iter 12 | node_modules type errors; skipLibCheck workaround exists. Requires `npm install`. |
| electron-updater not installed | iter 4 | Intentional: TODO listed in updater.ts. Install with `npm install electron-updater`. |
| react-hooks ESLint plugin missing | iter 12 | `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` rule not found. Install `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`. |
