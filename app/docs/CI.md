# CI + local testing

This doc explains the CI topology, how to run each check locally, and the
ratchet plan for the remaining soft-fail job (`tsc`).

## Workflows

Three GitHub Actions workflows, all in `.github/workflows/`:

### `ci.yml` — every PR + push to `main`

Fast, parallel jobs that gate merges:

| Job | Runner | ~Time | Gates merge? | What it runs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lint` | ubuntu | ~1m | **yes** | `npm run lint` — eslint on `src/`, `tests/`, config files |
| `typecheck` | ubuntu | ~1m | **yes** | `npm run typecheck` — `tsc --noEmit` |
| `unit` | ubuntu | ~2m | **yes** | `npm run test:coverage` — vitest unit + integration + coverage artifact |
| `python` | ubuntu | ~2m | **yes** | ruff check, ruff format --check, mypy, `pytest --cov` |

Triggered on `pull_request` and `push` to `main`, or via `workflow_dispatch`.

### `e2e.yml` — every PR + push to `main`

macOS-only, because Playwright-Electron needs a real display and the
build targets `out/app-darwin-*/app.app`:

| Job | Runner | ~Time | What it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `build` | macos | ~8m | `npm run package` (unsigned), uploads artifact |
| `regression` | macos | ~5m | downloads build artifact, runs `tests/regression/` |
| `e2e-smoke` | macos | ~10m | downloads build artifact, runs `golden-path + pill-flow + ipc` |

Both Playwright jobs depend on `build`; the build artifact is reused so
we only pay the ~8 min Forge build cost once per SHA.

### `release.yml` — tag-driven GitHub Release (+ manual dry-runs)

Two entry points:

1. **Push a `v*.*.*` tag.** This is the primary way to cut a release:

   ```bash
   # make sure app/package.json version is what you want in the tag name
   git tag v1.2.3
   git push origin v1.2.3
   ```

   The workflow builds on macOS, produces an unsigned DMG (or a signed +
   notarized DMG if secrets are present), creates a Squirrel.Mac update ZIP,
   writes `latest-mac.yml`, and publishes a GitHub
   Release named `Browser Use Desktop v1.2.3` at
   `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tag/v1.2.3` with the DMG,
   update ZIP, and updater metadata attached. Release notes are generated
   from commits since the previous stable semver tag. The release
   workflow resolves that tag once, asks GitHub for PR-aware release notes,
   and falls back to a compare-based commit list when the range has no
   PR-linked changes. That keeps `What's Changed`, contributors, and
   `Full Changelog` deterministic across all platform jobs.

2. **`workflow_dispatch`** — for iteration and tester builds. Inputs:

   - `platform` (`all`, `mac`, `windows`, `linux`) — choose which assets to
     build and publish.
   - `signing-mode` (`unsigned`, `signed`, `notarized`) — controls macOS
     signing behavior.
   - `tag` (string, optional) — defaults to `v0.0.0-dev-<run-id>`.
     The workflow always creates a Release at that tag; if it contains
     `-dev`, `-rc`, `-beta`, or `-alpha`, it is marked **prerelease**.

   Example:

   ```bash
   gh workflow run release.yml --ref main \
     -f platform=all \
     -f signing-mode=signed \
     -f tag=v0.0.0-smoketest-$(date +%s)
   ```

**Cutting a signed release.** For tag pushes, signing activates
automatically when the secrets are set. For `workflow_dispatch`, use
`-f signing-mode=signed` or `-f signing-mode=notarized`. The required
secrets:

- `SIGNING_IDENTITY`
- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Without those secrets, every run is unsigned. `GITHUB_TOKEN` alone is
enough to publish the Release (the workflow grants itself
`contents: write`).

**Cutting a pre-release.** Use a tag with a recognized suffix:
`v1.2.3-rc.1`, `v1.2.3-beta.2`, `v1.2.3-alpha`, `v1.2.3-dev-20260101`.
The workflow flips `prerelease: true` based on substring match.

**Where to find the DMG after release.** Two places:

- **GitHub Release page** — `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/tag/<tag>`.
  This is the canonical user-facing download.
- **Workflow artifact** (14-day retention) — Actions → Release run →
  `agentic-browser-<sha>`. Backup path for internal use or if Release
  publishing fails partway.

**Auto-update feed.** The workflow publishes `latest-mac.yml` plus
`Browser-Use-<arch>-mac.zip` for macOS, and `latest-linux.yml` plus
`Browser-Use-<version>-x64.AppImage` for Linux. The app's `electron-updater`
integration reads those feeds from GitHub Releases, downloads the update in
the background, and applies it on restart or next quit. The DMG remains the
macOS first-install/manual-download artifact; Linux `.deb` and `.rpm` builds
remain manual install artifacts while AppImage is the self-updating Linux
channel.

**Version field.** `app/package.json`'s `version` is consumed by Forge
when it names the DMG (`app-<version>-arm64.dmg`) and by
`electron-updater` when deciding whether a release is newer. Prefer
`task release:publish`, which bumps and commits `app/package.json` before
tagging. If you push a tag manually, bump the package version first; the
release workflow fails fast if the tag version does not match
`app/package.json`.

## Running locally

All commands run from `app/`:

```bash
# TS side
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck          # must be clean (hard-fail in CI)
npm run test               # vitest
npm run test:coverage      # same + coverage/ report under tests/results/

# Python side — from app/python/
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
ruff check agent tests
ruff format --check agent tests
mypy agent                 # hard-fail in CI; baseline clean
pytest --cov=agent

# Playwright e2e (needs packaged app)
npm run package            # one-time per ref
npx playwright test --config=tests/setup/playwright.config.ts tests/regression/
```

The `qa` script bundles lint + typecheck + test: `npm run qa`.

## Soft-fail rollout — cleaned up

Both `tsc --noEmit` and `mypy` used to run soft-fail against pre-existing
baselines. Both have been cleaned up and now hard-fail on any new error:

- **TS (`tsc --noEmit`)** — ~104 errors cleaned up (missing `.svg` module
  declarations, stale test mock types, Vite/forge config drift, React 19
  typings, settings preload-bridge drift, API drift across electron-forge
  and PrintPreview).
- **Python (`mypy`)** — 5 errors cleaned up (`schemas.py` TypedDict
  `version` literal mismatches, `llm.py` None-vs-Anthropic assignment,
  `loop.py` `Any` returns).

The same soft-fail treatment applies to the Playwright jobs in `e2e.yml`:

- **`regression`** — `preload-path.spec.ts` fails with
  `electron.launch: Timeout 30000ms exceeded` both on CI and locally.
  The Electron process starts and attaches the debugger, but the
  `_electron.launch()` promise never resolves. Suspected cause is a
  missing init step (perhaps daemon spawn or a renderer ready signal
  that the packaged build doesn't emit when launched outside a real
  UI session). Soft-fail until debugged.
- **`e2e-smoke`** — same launch hang, same fix.

### Flipping to hard-fail

When a baseline is clean, remove `continue-on-error: true` from its job.
The comments in each workflow mark the exact lines.

### Preventing regression while soft

Each PR should not **increase** the error count for the remaining
soft-fail jobs (Playwright e2e suites). Reviewers check the Actions
log — soft-fail jobs still run, still print diffs, and still produce
a red check next to the green merge status. A PR that adds a new
error in a file that was previously clean should be
sent back.

## Coverage

The vitest config writes `lcov` + `json-summary` to
`app/tests/results/coverage/`. Pytest writes `coverage.xml` to
`app/python/`. Both are uploaded as workflow artifacts on every `unit`
or `python` job run (names: `coverage-ts`, `coverage-python`).

Coverage is measured but not gated. See `reagan_DIRECTIVES.md` D1 for the
per-module ≥80% expectation on new code — reviewer-enforced for now,
ratchet-enforced later.

## Adding a new test

**Vitest unit** — create `tests/unit/<area>/<name>.test.ts`. It's picked
up automatically by the `include` glob in `vitest.config.ts`.

**Vitest integration** — `tests/integration/<name>.test.ts`. Same picker.
Integration tests may import from `src/main/` and rely on the electron
mock at `tests/fixtures/electron-mock.ts` (aliased via vitest config).

**Playwright e2e** — `tests/e2e/<name>.spec.ts`. Must use
`launchApp()` from `tests/setup/electron-launcher.ts`. Runs against the
packaged app, not `npm start`. Add to the e2e-smoke job in `e2e.yml` if
it's a "must-pass every PR" test; otherwise it's a heavier spec that
runs only on main via a separate workflow (not set up yet).

**Pytest** — `app/python/tests/test_<module>.py`. Picked up by
pyproject.toml config. `pytest --cov=agent` runs in CI.

## Dependabot

`.github/dependabot.yml` opens grouped weekly PRs for JS and pip deps
(`npm` in `/app`, `pip` in `/app/python`), plus monthly GitHub
Actions version bumps. Grouped by electron / react / testing / eslint
so we don't get 12 PRs for one ecosystem update.

## CODEOWNERS

`.github/CODEOWNERS` routes CI infrastructure, forge config, src/main,
src/shared, and python/ to `@sauravpanda` for review. Add more owners
as the team grows.
