# Contributing to Browser Use Desktop

Install these first:

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev) (`brew install go-task` on macOS)
- Node.js 22
- Yarn

From root:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/desktop.git
cd desktop
task up
```

`task up` installs dependencies, patches the local Electron app bundle, and
starts the desktop app. 

Useful development commands:

```bash
task --list          # show available tasks
task lint            # run ESLint
task typecheck       # run tsc --noEmit
cd app && yarn test  # run unit and integration tests
task make            # build platform installers
```

Linux packages are built in Docker:

```bash
task linux:make:docker
```
